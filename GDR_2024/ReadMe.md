# Abstract

Surface heterogeneities can greatly affect the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), through changes
in surface roughness, humidity, or heat fluxes. Recent improvements of satellite imagery allow the
observation of the response of the ABL to such heterogeneities at small scales. Those images
suggest that the ABL response could be scale-dependent (e.g. advection could play a non negligible
role). While this type of air-sea interactions has been largely studied at larger scales, atmosphere
response to SST front of width of 1-10km is not well understood. Using Large Eddy Simulations
(LES), an idealized SST front is investigated. A coherent structure analysis is conducted to
understand the processes involved in the atmosphere response.
